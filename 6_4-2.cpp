Title: Solving Memory Leaks with Virtual Destructors
By declaring the base class destructor as virtual, the derived class destructors are properly invoked when deleting through base class pointers.
Ensures correct deallocation of dynamically allocated memory using raw pointers and manual new/delete operations.
Main Concept: Virtual destructors, safe manual memory management, resource deallocation in inheritance.
